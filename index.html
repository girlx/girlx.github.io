          <p class="body">I have published about Asian Americans in ethnic publications, including A-List Magazine, The Hmong Tribune, The kNOw Youth Media, Txhawb Magazine, and I started the online platforms and led the digital editorial work for Asian Pacific Review at my alma mater. Asian Pacific Review is one of the last ethnic print newspapers in higher education.</p>

          <p class="body">In 2014-2015, I worked on the Hmongstory 40 project, where I supported programs, communications, organized volunteers, researched, and wrote for the exhibition.</p>

          <p class="body">Between 2014 and 2017, I was a two-times fellow with the Pan Valley Institute, a project of the American Friends Service Committee since 1998. The Pan Valley Institute center learning experiences in civic, economic, and political life for fellows from immigrant communities in the California Central Valley.</p>

          <p class="body">In 2017, I received the Critical Refugee Collective grant given by the University of California Critical Refugee Collective, which funded the printing of the zine series MAI. In 2018, I joined Legacies of War to organize the LaoNow2018 Creative Feast in New York City. From 2017-2019, I co-founded and co-edited maivmai, a digital Hmong American Literary Press. In 2019, I joined the team at Little Laos on the Prairie as a writer and editor-in-training!</p>

          <p class="body">I opened Hlub Paper Studio to house my creative handmade and handcrafted work. I would love to work with you! Get in touch with me about your ideas.</p>
