          <p class="main-text">My name is Chelsey See Xiong. My mother gave birth to me in a refugee camp, south of the Mekong River. When I was 5, we moved to the United States. See was the name the immigrant officers gave to me because they couldn't pronounce and write my birth name as communicated to them by my non-English speaking parents. <a href="https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article26807572.html">Chelsey</a> is my preferred name.</p>
          
          <p class="main-text">My work center on the themes of community and spacemaking by elevating stories, organizing spaces for these stories to thrives, and focusing on the upmost deligence that people are treated fairly and with dignity.</p>

          <p class="main-text">Once-upon-a-time, I dreamt of getting a phd in education and teaching at the collegiate level but covid-19 crashed that dream by showing me that the most innovative ways to support a community may be outside the ivory towers, not another round of applications in hope of someday being an underpaid non-tentured lecturer in an underfunded academic department. <a href="https://www.bitwiseindustries.com">Bitwise Industries</a> showed me that when at the onset of the pandemic, their team members <a href="https://abc30.com/bitwise-grocery-delivery-help-tulare-county-fresno/6018186/">volunteered</a> to deliver groceries to people who were elders or sick.</p>

          <p class="main-text">Today, I am a software quality assurance apprentice with the Bitwise Industries Workforce Training program, where I get to combine my love for community growth, placemaking, and technology to ensure that folks who are not very good at math and not very rich can also be innovators in the tech industries.</p>

          <p class="main-text">Also, I worked on this really cool project called Hmongstory 40. Learn more at <a href="http://www.hmongstory40.org">Hmongstory40.org</a></p>
